## Project setup

npm install

# This command installs all the project dependencies listed in the package.json file.

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

npm run serve

# This command starts the development server.
# It compiles the project and sets up hot-reloading,
# which automatically reloads the page when there are changes in the source code.

### Compiles and minifies for production

npm run build

# This command compiles the project for a production environment.
# It optimizes and minifies the files, resulting in a more efficient and smaller package,
# ready to be deployed to a production server.

### Lints and fixes files

npm run lint

# This command runs the linting tool, which analyzes the source code to find and fix style issues and common errors.
# Linting helps maintain cleaner and more consistent code.

### Customize configuration

# To customize the project configuration, see the Vue CLI configuration reference at the link below:
